- âœ… Preview deployments: Preview deployment created for every Pull Request

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set
2. **Check package.json**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
3. **View Build Logs**: Check detailed build logs in Vercel Dashboard

### Environment Variable Errors
1. **"references Secret which does not exist"**: Ensure environment variables are set manually in Vercel Dashboard, not referenced in `vercel.json`
2. **Environment variables not working**: Ensure environment variables are set for "Production", "Preview", and "Development"
3. **Redeploy required**: After modifying environment variables, redeploy is required for changes to take effect

### Runtime Errors
1. **Check browser console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Check network requests**: Ensure API calls are working properly
3. **Check environment variables**: Ensure frontend can access environment variables

### TypeScript Build Errors
1. **"Cannot find module"**: Ensure `tsconfig.json` properly excludes unnecessary files
2. **Type errors**: Check TypeScript configuration and type definitions
